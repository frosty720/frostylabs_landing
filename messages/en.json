        "answer": "No! FrostyFlow is designed to be fully no-code. Our visual workflow builder and AI-powered natural language interface let you create sophisticated automation without writing a single line of code."

      },
      {
        "question": "Is my wallet safe? Do I need crypto to get started?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How is FrostyFlow different from Zapier or Make?",
        "answer": "FrostyFlow combines the best of both worlds: powerful Web3-native integrations AND traditional automation. Unlike Zapier or Make, we offer blockchain-specific tools (token analysis, DeFi operations, security audits) powered by advanced AI that can make autonomous decisions. Plus, you can build autonomous AI agents, not just simple workflows. And yes—you can also automate non-blockchain tasks like any other platform!"
